âœ… What is Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) in Kubernetes?
Horizontal scaling = scaling out/in â†’ adding/removing pod replicas.

HPA automatically adjusts the number of pods in a Deployment, ReplicaSet, or StatefulSet based on observed metrics like:

CPU utilization (default)

Memory usage

Or custom/external metrics (with proper adapters)

ðŸ“Œ Example:
If CPU usage > 80%, HPA can increase pod replicas from 2 â†’ 4.

âœ… What is Vertical Scaling in Kubernetes?
Vertical scaling = scaling up/down â†’ increasing/decreasing resources (CPU/memory) for a pod.

This is done by adjusting the resources.requests and resources.limits of a container.

Kubernetes does NOT do vertical scaling automatically by default, but tools like:

Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) can help

VPA can recommend or apply resource changes

ðŸ“Œ Example:
Change pod CPU from 500m to 1000m.

âœ… Does Kubernetes Automatically Do HPA?
No, Kubernetes does not apply HPA by default.
You must:

Deploy the metrics server

Create an HPA object manually using:

bash
Copy
Edit
kubectl autoscale deployment <name> --cpu-percent=50 --min=1 --max=5
So, you must configure HPA, and install the metrics server first.

âœ… What is metrics-server in Kubernetes?
A cluster add-on that collects resource metrics (like CPU, memory) from nodes and pods.

Required for HPA and VPA to work.

It serves metrics via the Kubernetes API.

ðŸ“Œ Without metrics-server, autoscalers (like HPA) wonâ€™t have data to decide scaling.

âœ… What are Kubernetes SIGs (Special Interest Groups)?
SIG = Special Interest Group

Kubernetes has multiple SIGsâ€”community groups focused on different areas of the project:

Example SIGs:

sig-node: node-related features

sig-scheduling: pod scheduling

sig-storage: persistent storage

sig-auth: security and authentication

They define standards, roadmap, features, and code contributions in those areas.

You can find them here: https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig
